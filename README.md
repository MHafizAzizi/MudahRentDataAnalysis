The scraping is based on this machine learning project by Aditya Arie Wijaya 

https://adtarie.net/posts/005-webscraping-machinelearning-rent-pricing/

Mudah Scraping Rental Property.ipynb shows the coding process of the scraping, its essentially the same as Aditya's coding with some slight modification.

all_states_rent.csv contains all of the states rental property data into a single file, if you want to see each states separately see the States file.

This is just a part 1 of the scraping, part 2 will cover more property details such as furnished or not, building details, facilities provided
